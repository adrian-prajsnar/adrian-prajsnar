# Hi, I'm Adrian! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a self-driven programmer who enjoys challenges, constant improvement, and sees no problem without a solution.
I've been immersed in the world of web development since September 2022, turning a simple curiosity into a way of life.

## 🚀 About me

- 💼 I work as a Senior EMEA eChannel Agent at Farnell Electronics, where I am actively involved in overseeing and ensuring the seamless processing of orders for premium customers across Europe.
- 💻 Web development is my driving force and I'm always looking for new challenges to improve my skills. In January 2024, I landed my first commercial project as a freelance front-end developer, where I have developed a machine learning web application. You can see my work here -> [app.mlab0.com](https://app.mlab0.com/)
- 🌐 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS & RWD, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Redux React Router, React Query, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Supabase, Git & GitHub.

## 🌱 What I'm up to
